# [No Prank](https://example.com/questions)

This project is a fun and playful "No Button Prank" web page. When users try to click the "No" button, it will move away, making it impossible to click. This project is perfect for surprising friends or just having a good laugh.

## How It Works

- The web page displays a playful message asking if the user is happy to see the code.
- There are two buttons: "Yes" and "No".
- When the user tries to click the "No" button, the button moves away from the cursor, preventing the user from clicking it.
- The "Yes" button remains stationary, allowing the user to click it.

## Features

- **Moving No Button:** The "No" button moves away when the cursor gets close, making it challenging for the user to click.
- **Interactive Experience:** The buttons are styled with playful colors and the page features a fun background image.
- **Responsive Design:** The button positions are adjusted based on the screen size.
